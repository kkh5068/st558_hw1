This is an interdisciplinary role, so a data scientist may pull from several fields including computer science, math, engineering, and statistics. A data scientist can be an ambiguous term as it means a lot of different things to different people.\n\n\n\nA statistician has more of a defined mathematical role which focuses on numeric, structured data sets. The statistician will focus on building models and stay within the world of science or math.Conversely, a data scientist can be more of a cross-functional role and may work with nontraditional data types. A data scientists have to critically think about how to use and process data to answer business or social questions.\n\n\n\nI fit into this because I want to represent and communicate data accurately and clearly as a horticultural researcher. This means I need to have a background in statistics to handle data correctly. It also means I have to make decisions in how and which data to collect - this can take a long time to understand!
